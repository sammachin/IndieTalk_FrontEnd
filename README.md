IndieTalk_FrontEnd
==================

Front End client code for Indie Talk

This is a Level1 release of Indie Talk, a project compatible with the aims of [The Talk Project](http://talkproject.org).

Level 1 means its the simplest level of self hosting, all you need to do is serve these static files from your own domain, all the backend infrastructure to enable calling is provided by me, Higher Level releases of the backend code will be coming soon so you can run the whole service yourself if you wish.

To get started just download the code and place it in a folder on your site, the suggested locaiton is /talk but it should work with most paths, any problems please raise an issue here.
